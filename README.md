# Stacker_Game
HOW TO PLAY?

The goal of the game is to align rows of moving blocks on top of each other. There is a row of five cubes which move side to side on the screen, at the first row. When the player pushes the (spacebar), the row of squares will stop. Then, another moving row of five squares appears above the previous row, moving faster than the one before it. If the squares do not align directly above the previous set, any overhanging squares will be removed. If the player misses completely, the game is over. The goal is to consistently get the squares directly above the previous set, "stacking" them to the last layer.
